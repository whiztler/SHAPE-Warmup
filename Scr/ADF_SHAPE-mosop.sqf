REINFORCEMENTS<br/><br/>
SHAPE HQ has a limited number of reinforcement positions available for unforeseen accidents at the start of campaign deployment. These 'respawn tickets' are to be used for unforeseen deaths/accidents only. 
<br/><br/>Mobile Head Quarters (MHQ)<br/><br/>
The Co CMD can used the MHQ vehicle to set-up a small reinforcements F.O.B. close to the front-line. This ensures quick access to reinforcements. The F.O.B . can only be deployed when the MHQ is stationary. Please note that unpacking (and packing-up) the F.O.B. takes considerable time which leaves the MHQ venerable to an attack. Make sure you deploy in a secure location.<br/>
Once the F.O.B. has been deployed, SHAPE HQ can send reinforcements to the F.O.B. location.<br/>
All reinforcements must remain at the F.O.B. until ordered otherwise by the CoC.
<br/><br/>SEMI-PERMANENT F.O.B.<br/><br/>
A F.O.B. can be created by transporting the F.O.B. containers to the desired location. The containers, 1 long container and 2 short containers, can be found at the M.O.B. or at the campaign deployment start location.<br/>
The engineers need about 2 weeks to build the F.O.B.<br/>
Command is responsible for resupplying the F.O.B. and maintaining security of the MSR. HQ will provide minimal F.O.B. security. An AA-unit will be issued to provide AA-cover.
<br/><br/>Deployment location<br/><br/>
Once an F.O.B. has been established, command can decide if the deployment location of troops will be at the M.O.B. or at (one of) the F.O.B.('s). This comes in handy for small recon teams, sniper teams, JTAC, etc.
<br/><br/>SPECIALIZED ROLES<br/><br/>
Specialized Infantry roles such as Combat Medic, Engineer and Explosives Specialists are require a specific loadout to function properly. Please note that other units cannot perform specialized tasks such as healing, explosive removal, etc.<br/>
Specialized kit can usually be found the unit's/team's vehicle.
<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT<br/><br/>
SHAPE is using the latest and most advanced equipment available. On QRF operations, SHAPE units are issued with one set of equipments as outlines in the QRF LOGI SOP.<br/>
Command is to make sure that vehicles are looked after properly. If a vehicle breaks down than engineers must be called in to do repairs. If the vehicle is beyond repair or it is not safe to repatriate the vehicle than the unit responsible for the vehicle must destroy the vehicle. Each vehicle carries at least 1 explosive supply.
<br/><br/>Replacements<br/><br/>
Command can request to have vehicles replaced or order additional equipment from SHAPE HQ. Orders can take up to weeks depending on the equipments. General and essential equipment usually takes around 4 weeks depending on the MSR.
<br/><br/>PERSONAL GEAR<br/><br/>
Personal gear is issued according to QRF Logi (ARMA3 Vanilla). Each role is equipped with specific gear. Gear can be supplements or replenished with additional/extra supplies in the team's vehicle.<br/>
Upon deployment, it is NOT ALLOWED to supplement/change gear without the explicit orders from the CO.
