ARMA Mission Development Framework

Mission Images.

To create your own mission images, best to use one of the existing images as a template.
Please note that images require certain dimensions, e.g.:

Flag	: 512 x 256 pixels
Logo:	: 512 x 512 pixels
Cover	: 2048 x 1024 pixels
Intro	: 1024 x 512 pixels

Create/edit your image in your favorite image editing software (e.g. Photoshop) and save as a PNG image with Alpha transparent background enabled.
Then load the the ImagetoPAA function from the ARMA3 Toolset and select the folder where you saved your PNG image and click on convert.
Copy the image into the missions' Img\ folder and edit the ADF_init_config.sqf file to load your image correctly.
